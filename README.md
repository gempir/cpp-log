# What is this

It's my very first C++ project and just for learning stuff about the language. 

# Run

```
git submodule update --init --recursive 


mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j8
```

# C++ Learnings

- Cmake makes projects, you don't need to run it all the time, make is enough for recompiling
